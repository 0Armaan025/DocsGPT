Our commitment extends to individuals of all backgrounds, including but not limited to age, physical attributes, visible or invisible disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Our promise is to foster a culture of open-mindedness, empathy, and kindness, contributing to a diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

In our community, we encourage behaviors that contribute to a positive environment:

## Unacceptable Behavior ⛔

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- **Sexualized Conduct**: Any form of sexualized language, imagery, or advances is strictly prohibited.

- **Trolling and Insults**: Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks have no place in our community.

- **Harassment**: Harassment, whether in public or private spaces, is not tolerated.

- **Privacy Violation**: Sharing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit consent is unacceptable.

- **Inappropriate Conduct**: Behaviors that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting are not allowed within our community.

## Enforcement Responsibility 👮🏻

Community leaders bear the responsibility of clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate actions in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Such actions may involve the removal, editing, or rejection of comments, code, wiki edits, issues, or any other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Community leaders will communicate the reasons for their moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope 🎯

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also when individuals officially represent the community in public spaces. Representing our community includes using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting and Enforcement 👮🏻

If you witness or experience abusive, harassing, or any unacceptable behavior, we encourage you to report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [contact@arc53.com](mailto:contact@arc53.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. We are committed to respecting the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
